# Fibonacci Number Generator

This project generates the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1. This tool allows users to input the number of terms they want in the series and outputs the corresponding Fibonacci sequence.
